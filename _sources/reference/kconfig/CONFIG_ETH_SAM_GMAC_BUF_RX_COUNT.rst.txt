.. option:: CONFIG_ETH_SAM_GMAC_BUF_RX_COUNT
.. _CONFIG_ETH_SAM_GMAC_BUF_RX_COUNT:

Number of network buffers that will be permanently allocated by the
Ethernet driver. These buffers are used in receive path. They are
preallocated by the driver and made available to the GMAC module to be
filled in with incoming data. Their number has to be large enough to fit
at least one complete Ethernet frame. SAM ETH driver will always allocate
that amount of buffers for itself thus reducing the NET_BUF_RX_COUNT
which is a total amount of RX data buffers used by the whole networking
stack. One has to ensure that NET_PKT_RX_COUNT is large enough to
fit at least two Ethernet frames: one being received by the GMAC module
and the other being processed by the higher layer networking stack.
