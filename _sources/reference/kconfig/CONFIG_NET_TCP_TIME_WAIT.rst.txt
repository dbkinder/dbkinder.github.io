.. _CONFIG_NET_TCP_TIME_WAIT:

Officially, the TCP standard requires a 4 minute timeout on
connection close before that particular port pair can be used
again.  This requires that the net_context and net_tcp structs
persist for the full duration, so has non-trivial memory costs
and is optional.  Modern systems with well-randomized sequence
numbers don't need this, but it is present for specification
compliance where needed.
