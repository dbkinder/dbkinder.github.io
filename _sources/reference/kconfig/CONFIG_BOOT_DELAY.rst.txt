.. option:: CONFIG_BOOT_DELAY
.. _CONFIG_BOOT_DELAY:

This option delays bootup for the specified amount of
milliseconds. This is used to allow serial ports to get ready
before starting to print information on them during boot, as
some systems might boot to fast for a receiving endpoint to
detect the new USB serial bus, enumerate it and get ready to
receive before it actually gets data. A similar effect can be
achieved by waiting for DCD on the serial port--however, not
all serial ports have DCD.
