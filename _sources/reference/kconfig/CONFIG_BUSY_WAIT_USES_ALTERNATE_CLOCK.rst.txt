.. _CONFIG_BUSY_WAIT_USES_ALTERNATE_CLOCK:

In tickless kernel mode, the system clock will be stopped when
there are no timer events programmed. If the system clock is to
be used to keep time e.g. to get a delta of time cycles then it
needs to be turned on using provided APIs. Some platforms have
alternate clocks which can be used instead. In that case this flag
would be set to true. This flag would be checked before turning
on the system clock in APIs that do busy wait reading clock
cycles.
