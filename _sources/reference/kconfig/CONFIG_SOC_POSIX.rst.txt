SOC for to the POSIX arch. It emulates a CPU running at an infinitely high
clock. That means the CPU will always run in zero time until completion after
each wake reason (e.g. interrupts), before going back to idle. Note that an
infinite loop in the code which does not sleep the CPU will cause the process
to apeared "hang", as simulated time does not advance while the cpu does not
sleep. Therefore do not use busy waits while waiting for something to happen
(if needed use k_busy_wait()).
Note that the interrupt handling is provided by the board.
