.. _CONFIG_BT_CTLR_FAST_ENC:

Enable connection encryption setup in 3 connection intervals.
Peripheral will respond to Encryption Request with Encryption Response
in the same connection interval, and also, will respond with Start
Encryption Response PDU in the 3rd connection interval, hence
completing encryption setup in 3 connection intervals. Encrypted data
would be transmitted as fast as in 3rd connection interval from the
connection establishment.
Maximum CPU time in Radio ISR will increase if this feature is
selected.
