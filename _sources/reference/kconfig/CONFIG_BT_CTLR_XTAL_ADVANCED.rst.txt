.. _CONFIG_BT_CTLR_XTAL_ADVANCED:

Enables advanced event preparation offset ahead of radio tx/rx, taking
into account predictive processing time requirements in preparation to
the event, like control procedure handling and CPU execution speeds.
Crystal oscillator is retained between closely spaced consecutive
radio events to reduce the overall number of crystal settling current
consumptions.

This feature maximizes radio utilization in an average role event
timeslice when they are closely spaced by using a reduced offset
between preparation and radio event.

By disabling this feature, the controller will use a constant offset
between the preparation and radio event. The controller will toggle
crystal oscillator between two closely spaced radio events leading to
higher average current due to increased number of crystal settling
current consumptions.
