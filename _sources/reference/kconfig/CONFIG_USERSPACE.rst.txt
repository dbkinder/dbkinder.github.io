.. title:: USERSPACE

.. option:: CONFIG_USERSPACE
.. _CONFIG_USERSPACE:

When enabled, threads may be created or dropped down to user mode,
which has significantly restricted permissions and must interact
with the kernel via system calls. See Zephyr documentation for more
details       about this feature.

If a user thread overflows its stack, this will be caught and the
kernel itself will be shielded from harm. Enabling this option
may or may not catch stack overflows when the system is in
privileged mode or handling a system call; to ensure these are always
caught, enable CONFIG_HW_STACK_PROTECTION.

This feature is under heavy development and APIs related to it are
subject to change, even if declared non-private.
