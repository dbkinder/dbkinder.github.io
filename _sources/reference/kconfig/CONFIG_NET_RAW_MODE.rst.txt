.. _CONFIG_NET_RAW_MODE:

This is a very specific option used to built only the very minimal
part of the net stack in order to get network drivers working without
any net stack above: core, L2 etc... Basically this will build only
net_pkt part. It is currently used only by IEEE 802.15.4 drivers,
though any type of net drivers could use it.
