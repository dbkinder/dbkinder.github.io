.. _CONFIG_NET_TCP_RETRY_COUNT:

The following formula can be used to determine the time (in ms)
that a segment will be be buffered awaiting retransmission:
n=NET_TCP_RETRY_COUNT
Sum((1<<n) * NET_TCP_INIT_RETRANSMISSION_TIMEOUT)
n=0
With the default value of 9, the IP stack will try to
retransmit for up to 1:42 minutes.  This is as close as possible
to the minimum value recommended by RFC1122 (1:40 minutes).
Only 5 bits are dedicated for the retransmission count, so accepted
values are in the 0-31 range.  It's highly recommended to not go
below 9, though.
Should a retransmission timeout occur, the receive callback is
called with -ECONNRESET error code and the context is dereferenced.
